    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>I will always be interested in food, chemically and physically. Eating to me, is understanding a culture and what it has to offer. 
        The care, sweat, and patience to make a dish tasteful is what I empathize in. However, the food that i enjoy the most, i would say 
        is an All-American Cheeseburger! Cliche as it is, you can't really go wrong with making one.....right?

    <h2>Professionally</h2>
    <p>Professionally, I am always interested in growing and making myself a better individual. There's too much knowledge
        in the world to stop learning. Comfort is the killer of dreams and potential. I stayed comfortable in my life for a short period of time. Additionally that caused so much chaos. Ironically enough, 
    it was the most stressful time in my life. Once i began to work on myself everyday and be better, i became lighter. That is what i strive for.</p>
